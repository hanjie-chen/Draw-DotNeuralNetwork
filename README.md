# Create a drawing of a feed-forward neural network.

This is a simple Python script to generate pictures of a feed-forward neural network using Python and Graphviz. This is heavily inspired by Thiago G. Martins [How to draw neural network diagrams using Graphviz](https://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/draw-neural-network-diagrams-graphviz/).
